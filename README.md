Hearth is a LavaLink Alternative that uses 20x less CPU cycles supports 60x more concurrent streams and uses 18x less memory. It does not support every feature of LavaLink but it does support most of them. And we are working hard on bringing Hearth to feature parity.
</p>
<h3 align="center">Features</h3>
<p align="center" >
<ul>
  <li>💨 Hearth is extremely performant and can support 60x more concurrent streams than LavaLink which means significantly less node servers potentially saving thousands of dollars.</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">🔐 Heath is very secure as unlike LavaLink it does not run on an outdated Java runtime</li>
  <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">🔧 Hearth is extremely easy to integrate into your project with our wide selection of client libraries for Javascript, Java, Typescript, and Rust. With more coming soon!</li>
