# Features and Other stuff to Implement:
- [ ] Test Full Command Set for client library
- [ ] Test with multiple workers. And with single scheduler and multi-work
- [ ] Final Benchmarks and make sure to update 10x claims or such everywhere to final benchmark numbers
- [ ] Set Badges
- [ ] Proper License
- [ ] Documentation
# Waiting for testing:
# TODO Post:
- [ ] Error Reports for message parse fails
- [ ] Rust Bindings -> Typescript/JS for Client Library
- [ ] Exponential worker discovery backoff
- [ ] Use separate IPC channels per thread saved in a DashMap. Otherwise constantly accruing threads will cause slow downs after a while.
- [ ] Scheduler fail over with dead marking if fail rate is high
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Worker Interface for dynamic joins and disconnects
- [ ] Add SoundCloud support. See `soundcloud` crate
- [ ] Swap `youtube-dl` with the `rustube` crate (May require forking `rustube` and modifying) (This has a few issues chunk throttling - age restricted downloads etc... see Issues on repo)
- [ ] Kafka Fuzzing
- [ ] Exposed Track Event System
- [ ] Add Effects (Timescale,Rotation,Vibrato, and Distortion)
